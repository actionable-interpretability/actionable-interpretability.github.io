We invite submissions to our upcoming workshop at ICML 2025. 

**An OpenReview submission link will be published soon.**

## Topics

Our areas of interest include:

1.  Practical applications of interpretability insights to address key challenges in AI such as hallucinations, biases, and adversarial robustness, as well as applications in high-stakes, less-explored domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
    
2.  Comparative analyses of interpretability-based approaches versus alternative techniques like fine-tuning, prompting, and more.
    
3.  New model architectures, training paradigms or design choices informed by interpretability findings.
    
4.  Incorporating interpretability–often focusing on micro-level decision analysis–into more complex scenarios, like reasoning processes or multi-turn interactions.
    
5.  Developing realistic benchmarking and assessment methods to measure the real-world impact of interpretability insights, particularly in production environments and large-scale models.

6. Critical discussions on the feasibility, limitations, and future directions of actionable interpretability research. We also invite perspectives that question whether actionability should be a goal of interpretability research.

    

    

## Tracks

We accept submissions under two tracks: **Workshop Track** and  **Conference Track**.

### Workshop Track

We welcome submissions of **novel, unpublished work**.  All accepted papers are considered **non-archival** (so they can be submitted to other venues), but will be presented at the workshop and will be displayed at the workshop website. Submissions will undergo a **double-blind review process** and must be fully anonymized. Please note that there will be **no rebuttal phase**.

#### Paper Types:

*   **Long Papers**: Up to 8 pages (excluding references and appendix)
*   **Short Papers**: Up to 4 pages (excluding references and appendix)
    

### Conference Track

We also welcome submissions that have been accepted to the ICML 2025 main conference and wish to highlight their work in the context of this workshop. These submissions will not undergo a second peer review process. Instead, they will go through a light-touch review, solely to assess their relevance to the workshop's themes.

## Submission Details

Submissions will be managed through Openreview (submission link TBA), and must follow [the official ICML template and formatting guidelines](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/AuthorInstructions).

## Dates
*  Submission Deadline: May 9 
*  Acceptance Notification: June 9

All accepted papers—across all tracks and types—will be presented as posters at the workshop. A select number of submissions will also be invited for **spotlight presentations**. Please note: for spotlight talks, at least one author must attend the workshop in person.
