The workshop on Actionable Interpretability@ICML2025 aims to bridge this gap by fostering discussions on how interpretability insights
can be applied to advance AI development in various domains. We seek to highlight work that
goes beyond analysis and contributes to concrete improvements in model alignment, robustness,
and domain-specific applications, as well as discusses the challenges associated with it.
